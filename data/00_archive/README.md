The facility lists datasets included here reflect the data presented at the Dakar facility list workshop from 31 January to 1 February 2023.

Since 20 January 2023, many improvements have been made to the facility list data, including addressing discrepancies between departments and health districts (of which were previously listed under "admin2"); completing additional facility verification; standardizing facility type and managing authority data (as well as providing both original designations and grouped ones); and incorporating new facility list data on hospitals and from two regions (Sedhiou and Louga).

Because the triangulation and matching processes generate and apply new "match_id" to each matched facility group, the "match_id"s found in these datasets do not necessarily link to the current facility list datasets.

Please contact us should you have questions about archived and/or current facility list datasets.
